# Image Processing Scripts

This repository contains two Python scripts for image processing tasks using OpenCV. The scripts are designed to process images by cropping, rotating, and analyzing specific regions of interest (ROI) for certain characteristics.

## Scripts Overview

1. **Crop and Rotate Images**
2. **Image Processing and Analysis**

## 1. Crop and Rotate Images

This script crops and rotates images within a specified directory. The processed images are saved to an output directory.

### Usage

1. Place the images you want to process in the `input_folder`.
2. Define the coordinates for cropping in the `crop_coords` variable.
3. Run the script to crop and rotate the images.
